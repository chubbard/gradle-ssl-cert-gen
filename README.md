# gradle-ssl-cert-gen
Generate SSL/TLS certificates within Gradle at build time with this plugin.  This allows you to support end-to-end encryption in containers using self-signed certificates generated at build time.  No additional integrations needed.

When using containers if you want to turn on SSL/TLS to your server you'll need a certificate, but getting that certificate on the container can be a pain.  You can copy a pre-generated certificate, but checking that into source control is typically an anti-pattern.  Therefore, you'll need some other place in which to copy it from which means fragile integrations with other systems potentially.  You could use an external secrets manager, but it's complicated to get the certificate on the file system before starting up your system.  Configuring something like "Let's Encrypt" is not straightforward in a container environment without creating your own images and managing that process too.  If you environment simply needs a self-signed certificate just to enable TLS/SSL on your server because your infrastructure sits behind a Load Balancer or other hardware that will present your actual trusted certificate, then this is a simple solution that doesn't require a lot of fancy configuration.

This is an all Java solution so it's portable and doesn't rely on any additional environment specific programs or requirements.  The plugin alone can create the certificate for you.
